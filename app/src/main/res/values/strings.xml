    <string name="about_us">Many people in our society are deprived of basic needs like clothes, books for their school-going children, etc. Several good-hearted people who are willing to donate gets indolent as they are not directly connected to NGOs at ease. Secondly, more than 20 million tons of e-waste is produced each year and it leads to e-waste pollution.  The problem could be solved by an Android-based application that would bridge the gap between donors and NGOs or recyclers(in case of e-waste).This would an NGO application. The donor will login into the application. The application will provide an interface having three separate schemes: DONATE CLOTHES, DONATE BOOKS AND RECYCLE E-WASTE. Later it will collect the details of donor like his/her address, schedule and materials which are donated. Based on the data provided by the donor, NGO/recycler will arrange for the pick-up and later forward it to the needy.Thus this application aims at solving the social and environmental problems.</string>
